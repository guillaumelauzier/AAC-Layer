
In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract includes a compliance check in the deposit function, which requires the user to pass a set of kycData before the transaction can be processed. The kycCheck function is a private function that is used to perform the necessary AML and KYC checks using the kycData.

When the deposit function is called, the smart contract first checks that the caller is the owner, and then calls the kycCheck function to perform the necessary compliance checks. If the compliance checks pass, the balance is updated with the amount passed as a parameter.

By embedding compliance checks in the smart contract code, it is possible to ensure that all transactions on the network are compliant with the necessary regulations. Smart contracts can be programmed to include a wide range of compliance checks, including AML/KYC, tax compliance, and other regulatory requirements, which can help to ensure that the network operates within the necessary legal framework.
