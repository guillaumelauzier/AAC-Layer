
In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract emits event logs to track the balance of the contract. The contract has an owner and a balance, and it emits an event log BalanceUpdated whenever the balance is updated.

The deposit function can only be called by the owner and is used to deposit funds into the contract. When the function is called, the balance is updated, and an event log BalanceUpdated is emitted with the owner and the new balance.

The withdraw function can also only be called by the owner and is used to withdraw funds from the contract. When the function is called, the balance is updated, and another BalanceUpdated event log is emitted.

By emitting event logs in this way, it is possible to track the history of the contract and monitor its behavior in real-time. Event logs can be used to track the flow of assets, verify the actions of network participants, and detect potential compliance issues, which can help to ensure transparency and accountability in the transaction process.
