
In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract includes an automated alert function in the deposit function, which is triggered when a transaction exceeds a certain threshold or involves a blacklisted address. The contract also includes a list of blacklistedAddresses and an alertThreshold that can be set by the owner.

When the deposit function is called, the smart contract checks whether the transaction amount exceeds the alertThreshold or whether the msg.sender is a blacklisted address. If either of these conditions is true, an alert is triggered, and an AlertTriggered event is emitted with the corresponding alert message.

By implementing automated alerts in this way, it is possible to detect potential compliance issues more quickly and address them before they become more serious. Smart contracts can be programmed to include a wide range of alerts, including threshold alerts, blacklist alerts, and other potential compliance issues, which can help to ensure that the network operates within the necessary legal framework.
