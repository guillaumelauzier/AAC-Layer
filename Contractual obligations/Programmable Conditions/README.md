In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract is used to include programmable conditions related to the release of funds. The contract has an owner, a funds variable, and a conditionsMet variable. The deposit function can only be called by the owner and is used to deposit funds into the contract. The releaseFunds function can also only be called by the owner and is used to release the funds, but only if the conditions have been met. The meetConditions function can also only be called by the owner and is used to meet the necessary conditions.

When the meetConditions function is called, the conditionsMet variable is set to true. When the releaseFunds function is called, the smart contract checks that the caller is the owner and that the conditions have been met. If these conditions are met, the funds are transferred to the owner, and the funds variable is reset to zero.

By including programmable conditions in the smart contract code, it is possible to ensure that all parties comply with the terms of the contract. Smart contracts can be programmed to include a wide range of conditions, such as the completion of a project or the delivery of goods, which can help to increase trust and efficiency in business transactions.
