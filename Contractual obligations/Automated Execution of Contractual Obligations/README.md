In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract is used to automatically enforce the terms of the contract related to the delivery of goods. The contract has a seller, a buyer, a price, a deliveryDate, and a delivered status. The confirmDelivery function can only be called by the buyer and is used to confirm that the goods have been delivered.

When the confirmDelivery function is called, the smart contract checks that the caller is the buyer and that the delivery date has passed. If these conditions are met, the delivered status is set to true, and the price is transferred to the seller.

By using self-executing code in this way, it is possible to ensure that all parties comply with the terms of the contract, and reduce the risk of human error or fraud. Smart contracts can be used to automatically enforce a wide range of contractual obligations, from payment processing to dispute resolution, which can increase trust and efficiency in business transactions.
