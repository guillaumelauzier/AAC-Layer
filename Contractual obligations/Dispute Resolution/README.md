In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract includes a dispute resolution mechanism in the form of an arbiter. The contract has a buyer, a seller, an arbiter, a price, a dispute status, and a settled status. The initiateDispute function can be called by the buyer or seller and is used to initiate a dispute. The settleDispute function can only be called by the arbiter and is used to settle the dispute.

When the initiateDispute function is called, the dispute status is set to true. When the settleDispute function is called, the smart contract checks that the caller is the arbiter and that a dispute has been initiated. If these conditions are met, the settled status is set to true, and the price is transferred to the recipient.

By including dispute resolution mechanisms in the smart contract, it is possible to resolve disputes more quickly and efficiently than traditional dispute resolution processes. Smart contracts can be programmed to include a wide range of dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration, mediation, and other forms of conflict resolution, which can help to reduce the risk of disputes and increase trust in business transactions.
