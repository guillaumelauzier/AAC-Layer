In this example, the SimpleSmartContract smart contract includes an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance check. The contract has an owner, a balance variable, and an amlCheckPassed status. The deposit function can only be called by the owner and is used to deposit funds into the contract. The function checks that the AML check has passed before allowing the transaction to proceed. The passAmlCheck function can only be called by the owner and is used to pass the AML check.

When the passAmlCheck function is called, the amlCheckPassed status is set to true. When the deposit function is called, the smart contract checks that the caller is the owner and that the AML check has passed. If these conditions are met, the balance is increased by the amount of the deposit.

By incorporating compliance checks into the smart contract code, it is possible to ensure that all transactions on the network meet the necessary regulatory requirements. Smart contracts can be programmed to include a wide range of compliance checks, including AML, KYC (Know Your Customer), and other regulatory requirements, which can help to ensure that the network operates within the necessary legal framework.
